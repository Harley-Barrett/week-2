        <h3>Different types of sports</h3>

        <ol>

            <li>Basketball</li>

        <p>Football is very fun to watch, every friday I get to watch our varsity team play for our school</p>

        <p>Basketball is an interesting sport, I was never the best at it but one time I played it at midnight with my brother and his friends and it was pretty fun</p>

        <p>Golf is a sport that I only really played when I was a kid, I remember going to a mini Golf course with my aunt and I had a lot of fun</p>
